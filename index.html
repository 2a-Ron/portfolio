            <p>
            Once the decision was made to leave the previous career for a new one in 2018, the field of Software Development became the starting point.  Utilizing skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery was benificial for a new Web Developer.
            <br><br>
            After web development an opportunity to learn C++ and the Unreal Engine 4 presented itself in early 2019.  The passion for Game Development grew from the friendly environment Epic Games provides to Indie Game Developers through their free pro level tool, Unreal Engine 4.

I am providing a list of <a href="portfolio.html">PROJECTS</a> I have created for personal and educational use to share with the public.  These are not Titles, instead they are small projects highlighting certain features.
